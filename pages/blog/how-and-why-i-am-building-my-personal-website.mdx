### Why?

Couple of reasons. To begin, it's been close to a decade since I wrote regularly on the internet and I think I miss it. So, I am going to start using this website to maintain a blog. "Why build it? Use something like Medium, Ghost...?" you say. Well, I'm a developer now and with a little bit of effort I can get pretty much the same blogging experience with a huge advantage of owning everything and having the flexibility to have fun with the design/layout. Now, another reason for building this website is for it to serve as a playground for all the cool technologies I come across. I swear there is a new one every week 😅.

Let's hope I stick to the promise of writing regularly here. If I do, I'll write on topics such as online education 📚, web development 🌎, developer experience 👨🏽‍💻 etc. Will try my best to keep them fun and interesting 😃. Also hoping that none of my rants end up here and stay limited to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/inishant).

> Writing on the internet give you massive leverage.

### How?

This website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) which is an extremely popular framework for [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and also my go-to framework for building any kind of websites. I highly recommend it. Lot of best practices built right into the framework by default.

The blogs are authored in Markdown using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). I could have set up a [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) backend to improve the authoring experience and to have a clear separation of content and UI but I want to avoid servers right now (or paying for hosted version of ghost).

For the UI, I have used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which really helps me "design at the speed of thought".

The last bit of fun I had was to implement a simple page views counter. For that I am using [Hasura](https://hasura.io) as the backend. And that's pretty much it in terms of technologies used. You can find the code for the entire website [here](https://github.com/iNishant/personal-website).
